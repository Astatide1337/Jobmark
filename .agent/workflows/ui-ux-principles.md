# UI/UX Design Principles

Reference these principles when designing interfaces for this project.

## Laws of UX (lawsofux.com)

### Core Laws to Apply

1. **Aesthetic-Usability Effect** - Beautiful design perceived as more usable
2. **Fitts's Law** - Make interactive targets large and close to users
3. **Hick's Law** - Fewer choices = faster decisions
4. **Miller's Law** - Keep items to 7±2 in groups
5. **Law of Proximity** - Group related elements together
6. **Law of Similarity** - Similar elements perceived as related
7. **Doherty Threshold** - Response time <400ms keeps users engaged
8. **Peak-End Rule** - Focus on peak moments and endings
9. **Von Restorff Effect** - Highlight important items by making them different
10. **Goal-Gradient Effect** - Show progress to motivate completion

## Figma's 7 UI Principles

1. **Hierarchy** - Use font size, weight, contrast, spacing to guide attention
2. **Progressive Disclosure** - Reveal complexity gradually
3. **Consistency** - Same patterns throughout
4. **Contrast** - Draw attention strategically
5. **Accessibility** - WCAG compliance, 1 in 4 users have vision issues
6. **Proximity** - Related items stay together
7. **Alignment** - Clean grids create professionalism

## 58 Rules Summary (UX Collective)

### Layout & Visual
- Use 8px grid system
- Maintain generous whitespace
- Limit font sizes to 2-3 scales
- Use consistent border radius

### Interaction
- Touch targets min 44x44px
- Clear hover/focus states
- Smooth transitions (200-300ms)
- Immediate feedback on actions

### Content
- Clear, concise labels
- Show, don't tell
- Use real content in designs
- Progressive disclosure

## Application to Jobmark

- **Quick Capture**: Apply Doherty Threshold (<400ms response)
- **Activity Timeline**: Use chunking and proximity for date groups
- **Reports**: Apply progressive disclosure for generation options
- **Analytics**: Use Goal-Gradient for streak visualization
- **Navigation**: Apply Serial Position (important items first/last)
